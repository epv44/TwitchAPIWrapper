# Twitch API Wrapper

## About
Very much a work in progress, however, this will be a generic API client with a dataSource wrapper allowing easy calls to the Twitch API.  There will be seperate dataSource objects corresponding with the JSON requests in the Twitch API and a presenter layer (utilizing the Delegate Design Pattern) that will allow users to hook in to the specific Objects they want.
